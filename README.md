Group 4 Project - Predicting Housing Prices.

In this report, we try to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, IA. Our data set has 79 different predictor variables to help predict our dependent variable of interest. Through extensive data exploration, cleanup, analysis, engineering and model building, we identify and rank four potential predictive models. We conclude with a recommendation, as well as an exploration of potential future model applications and extensions.
